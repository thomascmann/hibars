# hibars
A javascript tool for creating hierarchical, interactive bar charts, just for fun. Based on D3.js.

<h2>About</h2>
Hibars creates interactive SVG bar charts from CSV files containing the data to be plotted. The figures are "hierarchical" in that multiple factors can be specified on the X-axis, in a customizable hierarchy (see "Usage"). Each figure is created by a single function call, and is inserted into the page at a specified location.
